✅ Curriculum Guarantees

This master plan ensures:

No syntax remains “weird” — everything (::, 'a, <T>, dyn, Box, impl, etc.) is decoded fully.

You’ll understand lifetimes, ownership, generics, and async at a compiler-theory level.

You’ll know how to interface Rust with Go, Python, and AI pipelines.

You’ll be able to design, optimize, and deploy a Rust microservice ready for Cloud Run, NATS, or Kafka.

You’ll be able to profile and benchmark your code against Go, C, or Python implementations.
