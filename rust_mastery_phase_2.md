# Rust Mastery: Phase 2

## üß≠ Overview

You are correct that the 80/20 rule applies to the initial 14-lesson curriculum. It was designed to teach you the 20% of Rust that you will use 80% of the time, getting you productive as quickly as possible.

This document outlines the path to mastering the other 80%‚Äîthe concepts that transition a proficient developer into an expert, the kind who can design libraries, optimize critical paths, and lead a team. This is your roadmap for Phase 2.

## 1. The Non-Negotiable: Production Readiness

This is what separates professional, maintainable code from a working prototype. These are not optional skills in a team environment.

### Testing (Critical)
-   **What It Is:** Rust has a fantastic built-in testing framework. Tests are just functions annotated with `#[test]` that live right alongside your code or in a dedicated `tests` directory.
-   **Why It Matters:** Untested code is broken code. To ship with confidence, you must be able to write unit tests for your business logic (e.g., `process_event`) and integration tests for your service's boundaries.
-   **Your Next Step:** Create a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` block in your projects. Learn to test `Ok` and `Err` variants, use `assert!`, `assert_eq!`, and `#[should_panic]`.

### Ecosystem Tooling: `cargo clippy` & `cargo fmt`
-   **What It Is:** `cargo fmt` is the universal Rust code formatter. `cargo clippy` is an incredibly powerful linter that catches common mistakes and, more importantly, teaches you how to write more idiomatic and performant code.
-   **Why It Matters:** Professional teams require a consistent, high-quality code style. `clippy` is like having a senior Rust developer permanently reviewing your code. Heeding its advice is one of the fastest ways to improve.
-   **Your Next Step:** Run `cargo fmt` on all your projects. Then, run `cargo clippy --fix` and analyze every single suggestion it makes.

## 2. Deepening the Core: Advanced Rust Concepts

This is where you move from *using* Rust to truly *understanding* it.

### Lifetimes (`'a`)
-   **What It Is:** Explicit lifetime annotations are how you tell the compiler about the relationships between references, especially in structs and functions that hold them.
-   **Why It Matters:** You will eventually encounter a complex borrowing scenario that the compiler cannot resolve on its own. Understanding how to read and write lifetime annotations is the key to breaking through this wall and designing more complex, zero-copy APIs.
-   **Your Next Step:** Read Chapter 10 of the official "Rust Book" on generics, traits, and lifetimes. Write a function that takes two string slices and returns the longest one‚Äîthis is the canonical lifetime learning exercise.

### Advanced Error Handling: `thiserror` & `anyhow`
-   **What It Is:** `thiserror` is a crate for removing boilerplate when creating library-style error enums. `anyhow` is a crate for simplifying error handling in application-level code.
-   **Why It Matters:** The ecosystem has standardized around these crates. Knowing them is essential for reading and writing idiomatic Rust. `thiserror` makes your custom errors clean and powerful; `anyhow` makes your `main.rs` logic clean and simple.
-   **Your Next Step:** Refactor the `OutboxError` enum from Lesson 14 to use `thiserror`. Then, change your `main` function to return `anyhow::Result<()>`.

### Smart Pointers & Interior Mutability
-   **What It Is:** A deep dive into `Box<T>`, `Rc<T>`, `Arc<T>`, `Cell<T>`, `RefCell<T>`, and `Mutex<T>`.
-   **Why It Matters:** These are the tools you reach for when Rust's static ownership rules are too restrictive. `Arc<Mutex<T>>` in particular is the fundamental pattern for sharing mutable state between threads, which is essential for more complex concurrent applications.
-   **Your Next Step:** Write a program that spawns 10 threads, each of which increments a shared counter protected by an `Arc<Mutex<u32>>`.

## 3. Expanding the Horizon: Specializations

These are more advanced topics for when you need to push the boundaries of the language.

### Macros (Declarative & Procedural)
-   **What It Is:** The ability to write code that writes code. You've used macros like `println!` and `vec!`, but you can also write your own.
-   **Why It Matters:** Macros are the key to Rust's ability to eliminate boilerplate. `serde`, `tokio`, and `thiserror` are all powered by macros. Understanding them is the first step to building truly powerful, ergonomic APIs.

### `unsafe` Rust & The Foreign Function Interface (FFI)
-   **What It Is:** `unsafe` is an escape hatch that allows you to bypass some of the compiler's guarantees. FFI is the mechanism for calling code from other languages (typically C).
-   **Why It Matters:** While you should avoid `unsafe` whenever possible, it's necessary for two main reasons: talking to hardware or other languages (FFI), and implementing low-level data structures that are safe on the inside but can't be proven by the borrow checker.
