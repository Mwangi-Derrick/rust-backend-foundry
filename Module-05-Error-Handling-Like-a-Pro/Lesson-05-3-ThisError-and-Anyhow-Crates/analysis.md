# Lesson 05.3: ThisError and Anyhow Crates

## üß† Concept Summary

This lesson introduces two popular crates that make error handling in Rust much more ergonomic: `thiserror` and `anyhow`.

- **`thiserror`:** A crate for creating custom error types in **libraries**. It uses a procedural macro to automatically generate the `Display`, `Error`, and `From` implementations for your error enum. This reduces a lot of the boilerplate code that we saw in the last lesson.

- **`anyhow`:** A crate for handling errors in **applications**. It provides a single, general-purpose `anyhow::Error` type that can hold any kind of error. It is designed to be very easy to use and provides features for adding context to your errors.

### When to Use Which

- Use `thiserror` when you are writing a library and you want to expose a rich, structured error type to your users.
- Use `anyhow` when you are writing an application and you just want to handle errors in a simple and consistent way. You don't need to create a custom error type; you can just use `anyhow::Result` and the `?` operator.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

To use these crates, you need to add them to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
thiserror = "1.0"
anyhow = "1.0"
```

## üß© Code Walkthrough

Let's analyze the code in `main.rs`.

### `thiserror`

```rust
use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum MyError {
    #[error("IO error: {0}")]
    Io(#[from] std::io::Error),
    #[error("Parse error: {0}")]
    Parse(#[from] std::num::ParseIntError),
}

fn read_and_parse_thiserror() -> Result<i32, MyError> {
    // ...
}
```

This is the same `MyError` enum from the last lesson, but implemented with `thiserror`. The `#[derive(Error, Debug)]` macro automatically generates the `Error` and `Debug` implementations. The `#[error(...)]` attribute generates the `Display` implementation. The `#[from]` attribute generates the `From` implementation. This is much more concise than writing all of that code by hand.

### `anyhow`

```rust
use anyhow::{Context, Result};

fn read_and_parse_anyhow() -> Result<i32> {
    let mut file = std::fs::File::open("number.txt")
        .with_context(|| "Failed to open number.txt")?;
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
    let number = contents.trim().parse()
        .with_context(|| format!("Failed to parse '{}'", contents.trim()))?;
    Ok(number)
}
```

This function uses `anyhow`. The `anyhow::Result<T>` type is an alias for `Result<T, anyhow::Error>`. The `anyhow::Error` type can hold any error that implements the `std::error::Error` trait. The `.with_context()` method is an extension method provided by `anyhow` that allows you to add a descriptive message to an error. This is very useful for debugging.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Cross-Language Insights

- These are libraries that are specific to Rust. Other languages have their own libraries and idioms for error handling.

## üöÄ Practical Reflection

- **Boilerplate Reduction:** `thiserror` is a great example of how procedural macros can be used to reduce boilerplate code in Rust.

- **Application vs. Library:** The distinction between `thiserror` for libraries and `anyhow` for applications is a common pattern in the Rust ecosystem. Libraries should expose specific error types so that their users can handle them programmatically. Applications, on the other hand, often just want to display the error to the user, so a single, general-purpose error type is sufficient.

- **Error Context:** The `with_context` method from `anyhow` is a powerful tool for making your errors more understandable. When you are debugging an error, it is very helpful to have a chain of context messages that tell you what was happening when the error occurred.

## üß© Self-Review Prompts

- Add a new error variant to the `MyError` enum using `thiserror`.
- What is the difference between `context` and `with_context` in `anyhow`?
- Can you use `thiserror` and `anyhow` together in the same project? If so, how?
