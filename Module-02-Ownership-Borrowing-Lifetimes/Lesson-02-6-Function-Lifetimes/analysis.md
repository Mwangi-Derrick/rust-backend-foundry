# Lesson 02.6: Function Lifetimes

## üß† Concept Summary

This lesson focuses on the practical application of lifetimes in function signatures. While the compiler can often infer lifetimes for you through a set of rules called **lifetime elision**, sometimes you need to be explicit.

- **Lifetime Elision Rules:** These are a set of rules the compiler uses to infer lifetimes in functions so you don't have to write them out every time. There are three rules:
    1.  Each reference parameter gets its own lifetime.
    2.  If there is exactly one input lifetime, it is assigned to all output lifetimes.
    3.  If one of the input parameters is `&self` or `&mut self`, its lifetime is assigned to all output lifetimes.

- **When to Annotate:** If the compiler can't figure out the lifetimes after applying these rules, it will give you an error. This typically happens when a function takes multiple references and returns a reference, and the compiler can't tell which input reference the output reference is tied to.

- **The `longest` Function:** This is the classic example of a function that needs explicit lifetime annotations. It takes two string slices and returns one of them. The compiler needs to know that the returned reference is valid for as long as *both* of the input references are valid.

## üß© Code Walkthrough

Let's analyze the code in `main.rs`.

### The `longest` Function

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```

This function fails the elision rules because it has two input references and the compiler doesn't know which one the output reference is related to. By adding the `'a` lifetime, we are creating a contract that says:

"The returned reference will live at least as long as the shorter of the two input references."

### A Lifetime-Related Compile Error

```rust
let string1 = String::from("long string is long");
let result;
{
    let string2 = String::from("xyz");
    result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
}
// println!("The longest string is {}", result); // COMPILE ERROR
```

This code demonstrates the lifetime contract in action. `result` has a lifetime that is tied to the shorter lifetime of `string1` and `string2`. `string2` is dropped at the end of the inner scope, so `result` becomes invalid. The compiler correctly prevents us from using `result` after `string2` has been dropped.

### A Function That Passes Elision

```rust
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
    // ...
}
```

This function compiles without lifetime annotations because it passes the elision rules. It has one input reference, so the compiler applies Rule 2 and gives the input and output references the same lifetime. This is equivalent to writing:

```rust
fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    // ...
}
```

## ‚öîÔ∏è Cross-Language Insights

- This is a concept that is unique to Rust. Other languages do not have a comparable system for compile-time verification of reference lifetimes.

## üöÄ Practical Reflection

- **The Elision Rules are a Convenience:** The elision rules are there to make your life easier. You don't have to write out lifetimes for every single function. But when you do have to write them, it's because you are in a situation where the compiler needs more information to guarantee safety.

- **Think About the Contract:** When you are writing a function with lifetimes, think about the contract you are making with the compiler. What are you promising about the relationships between the lifetimes of your references?

- **Don't Be Afraid of the Annotations:** Lifetime annotations can look intimidating at first, but they are just a way of being explicit about something that is already happening implicitly. Once you understand the rules, they become a powerful tool for writing correct and safe code.

## üß© Self-Review Prompts

- Write a function that takes a string slice and returns the last word. Does it need lifetime annotations?
- What happens if you try to make the `longest` function return a new `String` instead of a `&str`? Do you still need lifetimes?
- Can you have a function that takes two references with different lifetimes? How would you write the signature?
