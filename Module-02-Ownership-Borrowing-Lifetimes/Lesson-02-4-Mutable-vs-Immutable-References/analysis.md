# Lesson 02.4: Mutable vs. Immutable References

## üß† Concept Summary

This lesson reinforces and clarifies the rules of borrowing that we learned in the previous lesson. The core of Rust's safety guarantees around references can be summarized in one rule:

**You can have either *one* mutable reference OR *any number* of immutable references to a value in a particular scope, but not both.**

- **Immutable References (`&T`):** These are read-only references. You can have as many as you want, because they don't change the data.

- **Mutable References (`&mut T`):** This is a read-write reference. You can only have one at a time, to prevent data races.

- **Scope of References:** A reference is considered "in scope" from the point it is created until the point it is last used. This is a key detail that makes the borrow checker more flexible than it might seem at first.

- **Dangling References:** The borrow checker also prevents dangling references, which are references that point to memory that has been deallocated.

## üß© Code Walkthrough

Let's analyze the code in `main.rs`.

### Many Immutable References

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &s1;
let r2 = &s1;

println!("r1 = {}, r2 = {}", r1, r2);
```

This is perfectly fine. We can have multiple immutable references to `s1` because we are only reading the data.

### One Mutable Reference

```rust
let mut s2 = String::from("hello");

let r3 = &mut s2;
// let r4 = &mut s2; // COMPILE ERROR
```

This demonstrates the "one mutable reference" rule. If we were allowed to have two mutable references, we could have two parts of the code trying to change `s2` at the same time, leading to a data race.

### Mixing Mutable and Immutable References

```rust
let mut s3 = String::from("hello");

let r5 = &s3;
let r6 = &s3;
// let r7 = &mut s3; // COMPILE ERROR
```

This is also not allowed. If you have an immutable reference, you have an expectation that the data won't change. If you could create a mutable reference at the same time, that expectation would be violated.

### The Scope of References

```rust
let mut s4 = String::from("hello");

let r8 = &s4;
let r9 = &s4;

println!("{} and {}", r8, r9);
// `r8` and `r9` are no longer used after this point, so their scope ends here.

let r10 = &mut s4; // This is fine!
r10.push_str(", world");
```

This is a crucial point. The scopes of `r8` and `r9` end after the `println!`, because that is the last time they are used. After that, we are free to create a mutable reference `r10`.

### Dangling References

```rust
// fn dangle() -> &String {
//     let s = String::from("hello");
//     &s
// } // `s` is dropped here
```

The `dangle` function tries to return a reference to a `String` that was created inside the function. But when the function ends, `s` is dropped and its memory is deallocated. If Rust allowed this, we would have a dangling reference. The compiler saves us from this by issuing a "missing lifetime specifier" error, which we will learn how to fix in the next lessons.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Cross-Language Insights

- **vs. Golang/TypeScript/C:** As we've discussed before, these languages do not have a borrow checker that enforces these rules at compile time. It is up to the programmer to be careful about how they access data through pointers/references.

## üöÄ Practical Reflection

- **The Borrow Checker is Smart:** The borrow checker is not just looking at the curly braces of a scope. It's looking at the *flow* of your program to see where references are used. This is called Non-Lexical Lifetimes (NLL), and it makes the borrow checker much more ergonomic to work with.

- **Error Messages as a Guide:** The borrow checker's error messages can be very helpful. They will often tell you exactly what the problem is and how to fix it. Learning to read them is a key skill.

- **Thinking in Scopes:** This lesson forces you to think about the scopes of your variables and references. This is a good habit to get into, as it will help you write cleaner, more correct code in any language.

## üß© Self-Review Prompts

- Create a mutable reference to a value. Then, create an immutable reference in an inner scope. Does it compile? Why or why not?
- Write a function that takes a mutable reference to a `Vec<i32>` and adds an element to it.
- How does the concept of reference scopes relate to the idea of "least privilege" in security?
