# Lesson 02.7: Structs with References & Lifetime Parameters

## üß† Concept Summary

This lesson extends our understanding of lifetimes to structs. Just like functions, structs can also hold references, and when they do, we need to use lifetime annotations to ensure the references are valid.

- **Structs with References:** If a struct has a field that is a reference, the struct definition *must* be annotated with a lifetime. This lifetime ensures that an instance of the struct cannot outlive the reference it holds.

- **Lifetime Annotations on Structs:** The syntax is similar to generic types. You declare the lifetime parameter after the struct name, and then use it to annotate the reference fields.

- **Lifetimes and `impl` Blocks:** If a struct has a lifetime, you must declare it in the `impl` block as well. The lifetime elision rules also apply to methods.

## üß© Code Walkthrough

Let's analyze the code in `main.rs`.

### A Struct with a Reference

```rust
struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    part: &'a str,
}
```

This defines a struct `ImportantExcerpt` that has one field, `part`, which is a string slice. The `<'a>` is a lifetime parameter. This annotation tells the compiler that an instance of `ImportantExcerpt` is not allowed to outlive the reference held by its `part` field.

```rust
let novel = String::from("Call me Ishmael. Some years ago...");
let first_sentence = novel.split('.').next().expect("Could not find a '.'");

let i = ImportantExcerpt {
    part: first_sentence,
};
```

Here, we create an instance of `ImportantExcerpt`. The `part` field holds a reference to `first_sentence`, which is a slice of `novel`. The borrow checker will ensure that `i` does not outlive `novel`.

### Lifetimes and Methods

```rust
impl<'a> ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    fn announce_and_return_part(&self, announcement: &str) -> &str {
        println!("Attention please: {}", announcement);
        self.part
    }
}
```

When we implement methods for a struct with a lifetime, we have to declare the lifetime in the `impl` block (`impl<'a>`). The lifetime elision rules apply here as well. The `announce_and_return_part` method takes `&self`, so the lifetime of the returned reference is tied to the lifetime of `self` (which is `'a`).

## ‚öîÔ∏è Cross-Language Insights

- This is a concept that is unique to Rust. In other languages, you can have objects with references to other objects, but there is no compile-time verification that the references will always be valid.

## üöÄ Practical Reflection

- **Data Ownership:** This is a good example of how Rust forces you to think about data ownership. If you have a struct that needs to refer to some data, you have to decide whether the struct will own the data (by having a field of type `String`) or borrow it (by having a field of type `&str`).

- **API Design:** When you are designing a struct, think about whether it makes sense for it to own its data or to borrow it. If it borrows, you will need to use lifetimes. This will make your API more explicit and safer.

- **The End of the Borrow Checker Saga (for now):** This lesson concludes our deep dive into the ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes system. You now have the foundational knowledge to understand how Rust guarantees memory safety.

## üß© Self-Review Prompts

- Create a struct that holds a mutable reference. What do you need to add to the struct definition and the `impl` block?
- What happens if you try to create an `ImportantExcerpt` where the `part` field outlives the data it refers to? Write some code to see the compiler error.
- Can a struct have multiple lifetime parameters? If so, how would you write the definition?
