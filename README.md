## ðŸŽ¯ Mission

To provide an opinionated, project-based, and AI-enhanced learning path for experienced software engineers to become proficient in idiomatic Rust for backend development, **fast**.

## ðŸ¤” Why This Repository Exists

Learning a new language, especially one as powerful and strict as Rust, can be challenging. Standard tutorials often focus too much on basic syntax, while advanced textbooks can be overly theoretical. This repository is different. It's built on a few core principles:

1.  **The 80/20 Rule:** We focus on the 20% of Rust's features that you will use 80% of the time when building backend systems (Ownership, `Result`, `async`, `struct`s, `enum`s, `trait`s).

2.  **Active Learning:** You don't learn Rust by watching videos; you learn it by fighting the compiler and seeing your code run. This is an interactive sandbox, not a passive lecture.

3.  **AI as a Mentor:** The analysis and documentation within this repository were generated by a large language model (Google's Gemini) acting as a world-class Rust instructor. This entire repository is a testament to a new way of learning: using AI as a personalized, on-demand expert.

## ðŸš€ How to Use This Curriculum

To get the most out of this repository, follow this process strictly. Do not just read the code.

1.  **Navigate Sequentially:** Start with the `01-variables-mutability-types` directory and proceed in numerical order. Each lesson builds on the last.

2.  **Run the Code:** Before reading anything else, `cd` into the lesson directory and run the code using `cargo run`. Observe the output. If it fails, try to understand the compiler error before moving on.

3.  **Read the Analysis:** After running the code, open and read the `analysis.md` file within that lesson's directory. This is the "instructor commentary"â€”a detailed breakdown of the concepts, cross-language comparisons, and practical reflections.

4.  **Engage and Reflect:** Each `analysis.md` contains "Self-Review Prompts." Take a moment to think about them. This active recall is crucial for cementing your understanding.

5.  **Review the Summaries:** After completing all 14 lessons, read the summary documents in the root directory (`curriculum_summary.md`, `rust_mastery_phase_2.md`, etc.) to synthesize your knowledge.

## ðŸ¤– The AI-Powered Instructor: Understanding `gemini.md`

This repository contains a unique file: `gemini.md`. This is not just documentation; it is a **prompt-as-config** file. It contains the high-level instructions that were fed to the Gemini AI to generate all the `analysis.md` files, the curriculum summary, and the roadmaps.

**This is a meta-lesson.** It teaches you not only Rust, but also how to leverage modern AI tools to create your own bespoke learning experiences. By studying `gemini.md`, you can learn how to prompt an AI to act as a domain expert, a code analyzer, and a curriculum creator.

### Adapting for Other AI Tools (Claude, Codey, etc.)

The power of the `gemini.md` file is that the instructions are largely model-agnostic. You can adapt this repository to be powered by any capable AI model or CLI tool.

**To do so:**

1.  **Identify the Core Prompt:** Open `gemini.md` and copy the core instructional textâ€”the sections defining the objective, traversal logic, output instructions, and desired persona.

2.  **Adapt the Invocation:**
    *   If you are using another AI CLI tool that accepts a prompt file (e.g., `claude run --prompt-file ...`), you can simply point it to `gemini.md`.
    *   If you are using a web-based AI chat interface, you can paste the core instructions from `gemini.md` into the chat window as a large context-setting prompt.

3.  **Regenerate:** Ask the new AI to begin the process, starting with Lesson 1. It will follow the same instructions to regenerate the analysis files, but with its own unique voice, insights, and style. You can effectively create your own fine-tuned version of this course with the AI instructor of your choice.
