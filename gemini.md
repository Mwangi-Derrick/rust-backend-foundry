# Gemini Audit Script for Rust Course (Lessons 01–14)

🦀 Author Context

Student: Derrick Mwangi
Context: Building a Rust outbox-bridge microservice (inspired by Golang implementation)
Languages known: Golang, Python, TypeScript, C
Goal: Rust mastery for resource-efficient, high-throughput backend systems.

## 🧭 Objective
You are Gemini 2.5 Pro CLI.  
Your task is to traverse each lesson folder (`01-*` → `14-*`) in the repository root.  
For each folder, read **all `.rs` files** and **comments (including commented-out code)**.

Produce **verbose, developer-grade analysis** and **cross-language comparisons** — referencing Golang, TypeScript, and C when useful.

---

## 🧩 Traversal Logic

For each folder matching `*/src/**/*.rs` or `*/main.rs`:
1. Parse the code.
2. Understand the **Rust concepts demonstrated**.
3. Analyze **functions**, **structs**, **traits**, **enums**, **impl blocks**, and **error handling**.
4. Include **commented-out code** in reasoning — explain why it might have been disabled, what it teaches, or how it could be re-enabled.
5. Detect **microservice-relevant patterns** (e.g., async, outbox patterns, message relay, cloud run simulation).
6. Compare the approach to:
   - Golang concurrency or channel handling  
   - TypeScript async/await + interface usage  
   - C low-level memory or pointer logic

## ⚙️ Output Instructions

### 1️⃣ Per-Lesson Output (`analysis.md`)

For each lesson directory (`01-*`, `02-*`, ...):
- Create or overwrite a file named `analysis.md`.
- Structure:

```markdown
# Lesson [N]: [Lesson Name]

## 🧠 Concept Summary
Explain the core Rust topics covered.

## 🧩 Code Walkthrough
Line-by-line commentary with **verbose explanations**.
Show what each function, struct, and module does — like `--log-level=debug or verbose(it's a joke no worries like the way celery uses it 😂 ...you get the humor...)`.

## ⚔️ Cross-Language Insights
- **Golang Equivalent:**  
  - Syntax similarities/differences  
  - Conceptual mapping (e.g., traits → interfaces)
- **TypeScript Equivalent:**  
  - Typing and structural similarities
- **C Reference:**  
  - Low-level memory or procedural comparison

## 🚀 Practical Reflection
How this concept ties into:
- Real-world Rust backend systems (e.g., your outbox-relay or cloud-run projects)
- Performance or resource optimization vs Go/Python

## 🧩 Self-Review Prompts
- What did I understand well?
- What confused me and why?
- Where can I apply this concept next (in Rust microservices)?


2️⃣ Combined Summary (curriculum_summary.md)

After all per-lesson analyses are complete:

Create a single markdown file in the repo root called curriculum_summary.md.

Format:


# Rust Mastery Curriculum Summary 🦀

## 🧭 Overview
This file synthesizes insights from all 14 lessons.

## 🧠 Learning Trajectory
Outline how each lesson builds on the previous one:
- Lesson 01 → Syntax foundations  
- Lesson 02 → Control flow and data handling  
- ...
- Lesson 14 → Cloud Run async relay (final integration)

## 🧩 Key Concept Clusters
Summarize common Rust themes:
- Ownership & Borrowing  
- Traits & Generics  
- Error Handling  
- Concurrency & Async  
- File I/O  
- Integration & Outbox Patterns  

## ⚔️ Cross-Language Reflection
Compare how you would implement the same in:
- Golang (goroutines, interfaces, channels)
- TypeScript (promises, classes, types)
- C (manual memory and structs)

## 🚀 Personal Reflection
Document growth milestones and “aha” moments:
- What patterns felt most natural given your Go/Python/TS background?
- Which Rust concepts challenged you the most?

---

## 🧠 Style & Tone
- Output should read like **a course companion written by a senior Rust instructor**.
- Use **verbose**, clear technical writing.
- Add **inline code snippets** for clarity.
- When unsure, reason out loud (show thinking steps).

## 💾 File Output Summary
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `01-*` → `14-*` `/analysis.md` | Deep per-lesson breakdown |
| `/curriculum_summary.md` | Synthesized overview and conceptual progression |

## 🔧 Example CLI Command
Once saved, run Gemini CLI at the repo root:

```bash
gemini run -f gemini.md --model=gemini-2.5-pro

If quota exceeds, fallback:
gemini run -f gemini.md --model=gemini-2.0-flash
